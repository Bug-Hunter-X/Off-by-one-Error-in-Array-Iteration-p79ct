This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The `BuggyArraySum.java` file contains code that attempts to sum the elements of an array, but due to an incorrect loop condition (`i <= arr.length`), it tries to access an index that is out of bounds, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `CorrectedArraySum.java` file provides the corrected code with the proper loop condition (`i < arr.length`).
